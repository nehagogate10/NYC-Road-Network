# Team Contract (rlwei2, staneja3, ngogate2)
# CS225 Data Structures Final Project

## Communication: 

1. Team meeting

    Our team will meet once a week every Thursday from 2-3 PM using Zoom. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with rlwei2. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting.

2. Assistance

    Each team member can be contacted through messages, messenger, email, or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we promise to respond to messages within 24 hours. 

3. Respect

    The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.


## Collaboration:

1. Work distribution

    Every week, we will meet together and decide on what we need to accomplish, and each member will then volunteer to work on certain aspects of our goal. We will make sure that everyone is happy with their workload before assigning the tasks. If there are unexpected complications or unforeseen work, we will keep open communication with one another and discuss it as a group. If no one volunteers, then we will challenge each other to a game of rock papers scissors and the winner gets to do it. 

2. Time Commitment

    Time commitment will be decided based on the weekly deliverables agreed upon during the work distribution. In general the expected time commitment by each member should be around 2 to 6 hours per week. If one member feels that they are spending more time than the others, they can bring the issue up and the work can be redistributed to even out the amount of time each member spends on the weekly goals. If a specific team member is routinely skipping their weekly responsibilities, then they will have to explain themselves to the group and if the issue is not resolved there it may be brought up with a staff member.

3. Conflict Resolution

    If the group is split between two opinions, then a vote will be taken and the course of action receiving 2 out of 3 votes will be accepted. If the disagreement is between two individual members, then a game of rock paper scissors will be the deciding factor (best out of 5, with a mediator supervising). As stated before, if the issue involves a member routinely neglecting their responsibilities, then the measures mentioned in the Time Commitment section will be taken.
