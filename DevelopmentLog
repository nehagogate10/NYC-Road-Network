WEEK 1:
- Found NYC map dataset, collaborated on writing the final project proposal and team contract

WEEK 2:
- Created a Makefile for our project
- Started creating classes. Created Node, Edge, and Graph classes
- Made public and private variables based on what our dataset provided to us.
- Starting to parse the node, edge and graph data given, in order to start creating our graph

WEEK 3:
- Worked on trying to parse the GraphML file, but ran into many issues and converted it to a CSV file for parsing
- Reformatted/fixed the minor errors in the CSV in order for parsing to go smoothly
- Successfully parsed the node and edge data files

WEEK 4:
- Finished BFS traversal, starting work on Kruskal algorithm and A* algorithm. 
- Replaced CSV parsing with custom GraphML parsing (we created our own parser class)
- Began test suite for algorithms

WEEK 5:
- Worked on and finished Kruskal's algorithm
- Worked on and finished A* algorithm
- Wrote the rest of our test suite, added thorough testing
- Finished Results and README files
- Created final presentation
